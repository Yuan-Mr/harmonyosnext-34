### 🌟【HarmonyOS Development Treasure Case Sharing】Development Ideas for a Multi-Device Adaptable Photo Beautification App! 🌟  

Hey folks~ Today, I unearthed a super practical gem while browsing HarmonyOS docs! The official team has long quietly provided numerous "one-develop-multi-deploy" battle cases, especially the complete implementation scheme for this photo beautification app, which I must share with you immediately! (搓手手.gif)  


### 🎨 Case Background: Photo Beautification App  
This case perfectly demonstrates how to adapt to four major terminals—phones/foldables/tablets/PCs—with a single codebase, covering three core functions: album pages, large-image preview, and photo editing. Let's dive into the干货!  


### 🛠️ Analysis of Four Core Technical Points  
#### 1️⃣ Dynamic Columns for Album Pages (Magic Code)  
```typescript  
// Listen for container width changes  
Flex({ direction: FlexDirection.Column }) {  
  ...
}.onAreaChange((oldValue: Area, newValue: Area) => {  
  this.gridColumn = this.getGridColumn(newValue.width);  
})  

// Column count calculation formula (wider devices get more columns)  
getGridColumn(value: Length): number {  
  return Math.floor(2 * ((parseInt(JSON.stringify(value)) / 360) - 1) + 4);  
}  
```  
💡 Core logic: Real-time container width acquisition via `onAreaChange` to dynamically calculate display columns. For example, the column count automatically increases when a foldable is unfolded, truly achieving layout breathing!  

#### 2️⃣ Two-Finger Zoom for Large-Image Preview  
```typescript  
Image($r('app.media.photo'))  
  .scale({ x: this.scaleValue, y: this.scaleValue })  
  .gesture(  
    PinchGesture({ fingers: 2 })  
      .onActionUpdate((event) => {  
        this.scaleValue = this.pinchValue * event.scale;  
      })  
  )  
```  
📱 Cross-device adaptation: The same gesture code supports touchscreen, trackpad, and mouse wheel zoom! HarmonyOS's `PinchGesture` has already handled interaction normalization for us.  

#### 3️⃣ Automatic Layout Flip for Editing Pages  
```typescript  
// Landscape devices: left-right layout | Portrait devices: top-bottom layout  
Flex({ direction: isLandscape ? FlexDirection.Row : FlexDirection.Column }) {  
  ImageArea()  
  Toolbar()  
}  
```  
🔄 Layout secret: Dynamically switch the Flex main axis direction via device orientation judgment—1 line of code for layout adaptation, 10x simpler than media queries!  

#### 4️⃣ Hierarchical Architecture Design  
```  
├─ Product customization layer (device-differentiated configurations)  
├─ Basic feature layer (album/editing universal components)  
└─ Common capability layer (network/storage and other underlying services)  
```  
🧱 Architecture advantages: Modifying device features doesn't require touching business code. Adding tablet adaptation only needs configuration in the customization layer—maximized maintainability!  


### 🚀 Development Pitfall Prevention Guide  
1. **Image caching**: Use `LazyForEach` lazy loading for large-image lists.  
2. **Gesture conflicts**: Add `.hitTestBehavior(HitTestMode.Transparent)` to the zoom area for click-through.  
3. **Performance optimization**: Use the `@Reusable` decorator to reuse components for filter previews on editing pages.  
4. **Multi-device debugging**: Use DevEco Studio's "multi-device preview" function to view layouts in real time.  


### 🌈 Battle Experience  
Trying this scheme to rewrite the company project, the adaptation work that originally required 2 weeks was actually completed in 3 days! Especially the dynamic layout scheme of `onAreaChange`, which is like opening a new world~  

The official team still hides more treasure cases, such as multi-screen linkage for [long-video players] and cross-device shopping cart synchronization for [shopping apps]. Next time, I'll continue to take you treasure hunting!
